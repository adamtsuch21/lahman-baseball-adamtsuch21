    QUESTION ::
        * Find all players in the database who played 
		  at Vanderbilt University. Create a list 
		  showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as
		  well as the total salary they earned in the 
		  major leagues. Sort this list in descending 
		  order by the total salary earned. Which 
		  Vanderbilt player earned the most money in 
		  the majors?
		
    SOURCES ::
        * collegeplaying, people, salaries

    DIMENSIONS ::
        * playerid, firstname, lastname

    FACTS ::
        * total_salary
		
    FILTERS ::
        * schoolid = 'vandy'

    DESCRIPTION ::
        * First I created a subquery where I calculated the
		  total salary for each playerid from salaries. I then
		  joined that subquery with the collegeplaying table
		  to get the schoolid for each playerid, and people
		  to get the first and last name for each playerid.
		  I then filtered for a schoolid of 'vandy' and ordered
		  it by total salary in descending order.
